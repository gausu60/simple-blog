    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Gausuddeen Shaikh and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!</p>
    <p>Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.</p>
    <p>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
        <li>React</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>Laravel Framework</li>
        
    </ul>
